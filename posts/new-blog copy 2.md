I was recently granted access to the [OpenAI GPT-3 Beta](https://beta.openai.com/), a very powerful language model that can be used to do all sorts of magic like chat bot generation, article summary, and a [lot more cool stuff](https://beta.openai.com/examples).

But the application that really excited me was creative writing (stuff like SEO generation is cool and all, but a also a bit dry for my taste).

I had previously seen [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/) use GPT to create an interactive text adventure game (try it, it's fun!) and that got me curious about what else the AI was capable of â€” especially when elements of both _creativity_ and _structure_ were involved.

I decided to test it against poetry and story generation, and this is the resulting write-up of those experiments.
